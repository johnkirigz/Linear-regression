# Linear Regression Models for Insurance dataset
# Insurance Dataset
I developed a linear regression model in the insurance.csv dataset to forecast the rates a client will pay depending on their age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and geography. I began with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the variables' relationships and to detect any outliers or missing data. I then divided the dataset into training and testing sets and used the LinearRegression class from sklearn.linear model to create a linear regression model to the training data. Lastly, i used the R-squared score, mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error to evaluate the model (RMSE).
